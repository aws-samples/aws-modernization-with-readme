# ReadMe Account 

## Create a ReadMe Account

If you don't already have one, create a ReadMe account and project. ReadMe offers free trials without having to input any biling information -- so you won't be charged for anything for building out this demo.  If you already have a ReadMe account feel free to skip this step but you will need to generate a new project for testing out the integration.

1. Sign up for an account on [readme.com](https://dash.readme.com/signup).
1. Provide a name for your project.
1. Skip uploading an OpenAPI spec by clicking "Skip to Dashboard".
