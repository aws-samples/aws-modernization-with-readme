## Introduction

Welcome to the "Seamless API Documentation with ReadMe and AWS API Gateway" workshop. This hands-on session is designed to guide you through the process of integrating your AWS API Gateway with ReadMe, ensuring your API documentation is always current and accurately reflects your API's latest changes.

During the workshop, you will start by setting up the prerequisites, including creating a ReadMe project if you donâ€™t have one, and gathering essential details like your project version, API key, and API definition ID. You'll also need to ensure your API Gateway stage is deployed and take note of its ID, stage name, and type (REST or HTTP).
